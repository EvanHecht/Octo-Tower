Octo Tower is a rogue-like game I created. It is a randomly generated floor based game similar to The Binding of Isaac, where the player must progress through the game, obtaining new items, and get as far as they can without dying. It is to Asteroids as The Binding of Isaac is to classic Legend of Zelda.
